                Nagie’s Angels Pre-School welcomes children from age one (1) up to (five) 5 years, into our Crèche
                    class all the way up to our Kindergarten 2 (KG2) class. Our qualified staff offer a safe, caring and
                    stimulating environment for children to learn and develop.
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                There are seven areas of learning and development we instill into our learners, which make up the
                skills, knowledge and experiences appropriate for them as they grow, learn and develop. Using the Ghana
                National Curriculum for preschools, our learners receive:
            </p>
            <h2>Communication and Language Development</h2>
            <p>
                Involves giving children opportunities to experience a rich language environment, to develop their
                confidence and skills in expressing themselves, to speak and listen, in a range of situations.
            </p>
            <h2>Physical Development</h2>
            <p>
                Involves providing opportunities for young children to be active and interactive; and to develop their
                co-ordination, control and movement. Children must also be helped to understand the importance of
                physical activity.
            </p>
            <h2>Personal, Social and Emotional Development</h2>
            <p>
                These involve helping children to develop a positive sense of themselves, and others; to form positive
                relationships and develop respect for others; to develop social skills and learn how to manage their
                sentiments; to understand appropriate behaviour in groups; and to have confidence in their own
                abilities.
            </p>
            <h2>Literacy Development</h2>
            <p>
                Involves encouraging children to link sounds and letters and to begin to read and write. Children must
                be given access to a wide range of reading materials (books, poems, and other written materials) to
                ignite their interest.
            </p>
            <h2>Numeracy</h2>
            <p>
                Involves providing children with opportunities to develop and improve their skills in counting,
                understanding and using numbers, calculating simple addition and subtraction problems; and to describe
                shapes and many others.
            </p>
            <h2>Understanding The World</h2>
            <p>
                Involves guiding children to make sense of their physical world and their community through
                opportunities to explore, observe and find out about people, places, technology and the environment.
            </p>
            <h2>Expressive Arts and Design</h2>
            <p>
                Involves enabling children to explore and play with a wide range of media and materials, as well as
                providing opportunities and encouragement for sharing their thoughts, ideas and feelings through a
                variety of activities.

                Our Spacious classrooms and educational materials encourage curiosity and discovery. Your child will
                progress at the pace that is unique and perfect. In a patient, kind and nurturing environment, children
                learn to take responsibility for their growth, both academically and emotionally.

                Again, our highly qualified dedicated and robust teachers train children to acquire personal
                responsibilities like hand-washing, setting the table, and how to interact with others as they dress,
                clean, ask for help, and participate in the classroom. Through this, they develop self-esteem and
                independence.

                Nagie’s Angels is an excellent institution with all the needed facilities and resources for your child
                to develop the five needed skills for growth and development by every child. (i.e. Communication,
                Concentration, Curiosity, Confidence and Co-operation)
